A quick & dirty pass at generating a [ChakraCore](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore) P/Invoke layer in C# using [CppSharp](https://github.com/mono/CppSharp)

1. Clone this repo
2. Clone Microsoft/ChakraCore - you won't need to build Chakra as the headers are used to generate the P/Invoke. In your implementing program you can use the version on NuGet.
3. Ensure that the path in ChakraShare.CLI/Program.cs points to the path where ChakraCore was cloned.
4. Build and run ChakraSharp.CLI -- ChakraCore.cs will be generated. Take this file and use it in the application that you'd like to use Chakra in.

For a sample of how to use the generated ChakraCore.cs file, see [ChakraSharp-Sample](https://github.com/BaristaLabs/ChakraSharp-Sample)
